    question: 'How much horsepower does it take to run a mulcher?',
    answer: `Seppi Mulchers come in many styles and sizes with flail mulchers available for small 30 HP tractors while the larger stone crusher and forestry mulchers require upwards of 500 HP. The Seppi lineup contains mulchers suited for all tractors, compact loaders excavators and forestry machines. Bolt limiters can be installed in some conditions to protect a mulcher, the PTO and tractor if the tractors produces excess power. 
      <br /><br />
      Mulchers are also available for machines with hydraulics and Seppi products work with both High and Low flow equipment. These mulchers come in all sizes for skid steers, excavators and large forestry machines.
      <br /><br />
      Due to Seppi’s helical hammer pattern and lighter drum, less power is needed for mulching while allowing for quicker startup and return to speed while under load.

    question: 'What size vegetation can I mulch?',
    answer: `Flail mulchers are able to mulch grass and brush 2”-3”.
      <br /><br />
      Mulchers fitting on excavators are great for getting rid of trees and brush with diameters of 3”-16”. There is also a line for excavators that will demolish stumps of any size, till 20” deep into the ground and crush stones up to 6”.
      <br /><br />
      Skid steer mounted mulchers are capable of mulching wood up to 8” while larger forestry mulchers are best used to mulch wood, brush and stumps between 8” and 24”.
      <br /><br />
      Seppi also manufactures a line of multipurpose mulchers which can be used for both stone crushing and forestry mulching. There is a smaller model for skid steers which crushes rocks (6”) mulches wood (8”) and tills soil (4” deep). Larger models are capable of crushing stones and mulching wood up to 20” and tilling soil as deep as 14”.

    question: 'How much can I mulch in a day?',
    answer: `This depends on what is being mulched and relevant conditions. Mulchers come in widths from 49” up to 11.5 feet. While speed varies from 1 km/hr if ground being broken has many stones or can be 5 km/hr or higher if mulching brush.
      <br /><br />
      An 8 ft mulcher averaging 2km/hr would be mulch 8-12 acres a day.

    question: 'How long do the teeth last?',
    answer: `Seppi Hammers are hand made and each one is given its own serial number to ensure quality standards. The tungsten carbide tips lift the wood and rocks and repeatedly crush them against the specially designed wear plate so the teeth are not the primary demolition tool.
      <br /><br />
      While some hammers have lasted over 1000 hours, conditions determine how long they will last. For example, some material act like sand paper and will wear out your teeth faster than normal.
      <br /><br />
      With patented V.Lock technology, the hammers remain securely fastened to the drum and can be easily replaced if needed.

    question: 'Can I break ground in winter time?',
    answer: `Winter is a great time to break land. Land and equipment are not being used meaning mulching will not interfere with seeding/harvest. At colder temperatures rocks and trees are brittle and shatter meaning less power is needed.
    <br /><br />
    Another benefit is mixing frost and snow into the ground creating embedded moisture in the ground for future seeding.
