            The SMWA slim is a flail mulcher for tractors from 40 to 90 HP. It is characterized by an ultra slim belt
            drive with a low profile, which allows for high precision mulching in orchard and vineyard rows. The slim
            and low profile reduces the risk of touching and damaging the vines, trees, or branches. The narrow
            transmission is achieved by a combination of 3 plus 2 high power belts. This implement is reversible and
            features a linear hydraulic side shift.

            The strong rotor with the universal SMW flails distributed in a helical pattern ensures high cutting quality
            and evenly distributed power absorption. The casing of the SMWA rev cf is made of high-tensile steel and
            features two rows of counter cutters, which ensure a perfect mulching result. The adjustable roller with
            double tapered roller bearings guarantees a long service life and low maintenance costs. The roller is
            positioned close to the rotor to improve mowing on uneven ground and to prevent scalping. By means of the
            adjustable M-FLAP, the degree of mulching can be set to match the conditions so that the implement will
            always work at high efficiency and speed.
